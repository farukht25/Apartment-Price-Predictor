Apartment Price Predictor üè†

This project provides a machine learning model and a web application for predicting apartment prices based on various features. The core of the project is a data analysis and modeling pipeline developed in a Jupyter Notebook, which is then used to power a user-friendly application built with Streamlit.

‚ú® Features
Data Analysis: Explores a large real estate dataset to understand key factors influencing apartment prices.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares raw data, handling missing values and converting data types for model training.

Feature Engineering: Creates new, meaningful features (like building_age and price_per_sqm) to improve prediction accuracy.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to predict apartment prices.

Interactive Web App: A simple and intuitive web application where users can input apartment details and get a real-time price prediction.

Model Insights: The web app provides visual insights, such as how total area affects price and the most important features for the model.

üìÅ Project Files
House Prediction model.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the full data science workflow, including data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and training the machine learning model. This is where the model is created and saved.

app.py: The Python script for the Streamlit web application. This script loads the trained model and presents the interactive user interface for making predictions.

model.joblib: The trained machine learning model, saved as a .joblib file. (This file is generated by House Prediction model.ipynb).

feature_names.pkl: A file containing the names of the features used by the model. (This is also generated by the notebook).

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
You will need Python 3.x. All necessary libraries can be installed directly from the provided requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Application
First, make sure you have the model.joblib and feature_names.pkl files in the same directory as app.py. These files are generated by running the House Prediction model.ipynb notebook.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the Streamlit application with the following command:

streamlit run app.py

Your default web browser will open and display the application.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python - The primary programming language.

Streamlit - For building the interactive web application.

scikit-learn - For the machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor).

Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy - For numerical operations.

Matplotlib - For data visualization in the web app.

Jupyter Notebook - For developing and documenting the data science workflow.

Joblib - For saving and loading the trained machine learning model.
